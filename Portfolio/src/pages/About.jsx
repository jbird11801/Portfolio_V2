                    Hi everyone, my name is Jarod Fredette! I love playing games and programming sometimes a mix of the two if Iâ€™m making a mod! I enjoy learning about computers and working with technology, and hope to continue doing so for a long time. I strive to create environments where I can constistently grow, communicate, help others, and succeed as a team. In my day to day life, I maintain a positive mental attitude especially in high stress environments. I keep a positive work space. I enjoy practicing clear communication skills, and when I work with a group, I hope everyone leaves knowing more and in a positive mood.
